srt
===

SRT (SubRip Text) Web App. The goal of this app is to come up with a
single page app that allows easy creation and editing of SRT files from
your browser.

A planned feature is to help you preview the SRT files before saving or
muxing with a video file, so you can check the timing while your video
is playing in another window.
